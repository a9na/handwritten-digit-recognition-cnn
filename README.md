# handwritten-digit-recognition-cnn
This project involves creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model to accurately predict the digit in each image.
